# Brain-games

## Brain-games are five mathematical games in which the player needs to answer three questions. 
## If the player answers three questions correctly, he wins; if the player gives the wrong answer, the game ends with the player losing.


## In the brain-even game the player must answer the question whether the number is even or not

## In the brain-calc game, the player must determine the result of a mathematical operation
